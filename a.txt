<plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> of the family <family>Verbenaceae</family>, commonly known as <aka>alagau-gubat</aka> is an endemic Philippine plant found in low altitude places in <loc>Luzon</loc>, <loc>Philippines</loc>.

The <plantpart>leaves</plantpart> of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> are said to be a cure for <bodypart>stomach</bodypart> problems.

There are no reported studies on the chemical constituents of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant>.

In an earlier study, the <plantpart>leaf</plantpart> crude ethanolic <prep>extract</prep> of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> exhibited an IC50 value of 12.06 g/mL when tested in vitro on colorectal carcinoma (<cell>HCT-116</cell>) using the MTT assay.

Furthermore, the ethanolic <prep>extract</prep> possessed 78% free radical scavenging activity based on DPPH assay.

In this study, the <compound>dichloromethane</compound> <prep>extract</prep> of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> <plantpart>leaves</plantpart> yielded <compound>squalene</compound> and a mixture of <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound> and <compound>stigmasterol</compound> .

The structures of <compound>squalene</compound>, <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, are presented in Fig..

This is the first report on the isolation of these compounds from <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant>.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedure NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with <compound>vanillin</compound>/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Sample Collection The <plantpart>leaves</plantpart> of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> Blanco were collected from Brgy Tulay, <loc>Odiongan</loc>, <loc>Romblon</loc>, <loc>Philippines</loc> in January 2016.

The samples were authenticated at the Botany Division, Philippine National Museum.

General Isolation Procedure A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the chromatography.

The crude extracts were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of <compound>acetone</compound> in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment by volume as eluents.

Five milliliter fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns.

One milliliter fractions were collected.

Isolation of the Chemical Constituents from the <plantpart>Leaves</plantpart> of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant>.

The air-dried <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> <plantpart>leaves</plantpart> (298.6 g) were <prep>ground</prep> in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for <compound>stigmasterol</compound>, days and then <prep>filtered</prep>.

The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude <prep>extract</prep> <compound>stigmasterol</compound>, 8 g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of <compound>acetone</compound> in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment by volume.

The CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using petroleum ether to afford <compound>squalene</compound>, (4 mg).

The 30% <compound>acetone</compound> in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether.

Fractions collected from this column were combined and rechromatographed using 15% EtOAc in petroleum ether Phelan et al. / <class>Triterpene</class> and <class>Sterols</class> IJPCR, Volume 9, Issue 3: March 2017 Page 219 Figure 1: Chemical structures of <compound>squalene</compound> , <compound>betasitosterol</compound> and <compound>stigmasterol</compound> from <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> to yield a mixture of <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, and <compound>stigmasterol</compound>, (5 mg) after washing with petroleum ether..

Silica gel chromatography of the dichlorometnahe <prep>extract</prep> of the <plantpart>leaves</plantpart> of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> afforded <compound>squalene</compound> , <compound>betasitosterol</compound> and <compound>stigmasterol</compound> .

The NMR spectra of <compound>squalene</compound>, are in accordance with data reported in the literature for <compound>squalene</compound>; <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, for <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>; and <compound>stigmasterol</compound>, for <compound>stigmasterol</compound>.

The 6:1 ratio of the mixture of <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, and <compound>stigmasterol</compound>, was deduced from the integrations of the 1H NMR resonances for the olefinic protons of <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, at 5.33 (dd, J = <compound>squalene</compound>, 8, 4. Hz, H-6)4 and <compound>stigmasterol</compound>, at 5.33 (dd, J = <compound>squalene</compound>, 8, 4. Hz, H-6), 5.13 (dd, J = 9.0, 15.

Hz, H-22) and 5.00 (dd, J = 9.0, 15.

Hz, H-23)4.

Although no biological tests were conducted on the isolated compounds, a literature search of <compound>squalene</compound>, <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, revealed that these have diverse bioactivities.

<compound>Squalene</compound> was reported to significantly suppress colonic ACF formation and crypt multiplicity which strengthened the hypothesis that it possesses chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis.

<compound>Squalene</compound> showed cardioprotective effect which is related to inhibition of lipid accumulation by its hypolipidemic properties and/or its <bioact>antioxidant</bioact> properties.

A recent study reported that <compound>tocotrienols</compound>, carotenoids, <compound>squalene</compound> and coenzyme Q10 have antiproliferative effects on <bodypart>breast</bodypart> cancer cells.

The preventive and therapeutic potential of <compound>squalene</compound> containing compounds on tumor promotion and regression have been reported.

A recent review on the bioactivities of <compound>squalene</compound> has been provided.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> was observed to have growth inhibitory effects on human <bodypart>breast</bodypart> <cell>MCF-7</cell> and MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> was shown to be effective for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> was also reported to attenuate <compound>beta-catenin</compound> and PCNA expression, as well as quench radical in vitro, making <compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> a potential <bioact>anticancer</bioact> drug for colon carcinogenesis.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> can inhibit the expression of NPC1L1 in the enterocytes to reduce intestinal cholesterol uptake.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> was reported to induce apoptosis mediated by the activation of ERK and the downregulation of Akt in MCA-102 <compound>murine</compound> fibrosarcoma cells.

<compound>Stigmasterol</compound> shows therapeutic efficacy against <cell>Ehrlich</cell> ascites carcinoma bearing mice while conferring protection against cancer induced altered physiological conditions.

<compound>Stigmasterol</compound> lowers plasma cholesterol levels, inhibits intestinal cholesterol and plant <class>sterol</class> absorption, and suppresses hepatic cholesterol and classic <compound>bile acid</compound> synthesis in Winstar as well as WKY rats.

Other studies reported that <compound>stigmasterol</compound> showed cytostatic activity against <cell>Hep-2</cell> and <cell>McCoy</cell> cells, markedly inhibited tumour promotion in two stage carcinogenesis experiments, exhibited antimutagenic, topical antiinflammatory, antiosteoarthritic and <bioact>antioxidant</bioact> activities..

In an earlier study, the ethanolic <prep>extract</prep> of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> exhibited high <bioact>cytotoxic</bioact> activity against colorectal carcinoma (<cell>HCT-116</cell>) and free radical scavenging activity based on DPPH assay.

The <compound>dichloromethane</compound> <prep>extract</prep> of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> yielded <compound>squalene</compound> , <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound> and <compound>stigmasterol</compound> .

Compounds 15 and 212 were reported to possess chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis, while <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, was also shown to quench radical in vitro.

Thus, <compound>squalene</compound>, and <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, could contribute to the <bioact>cytotoxic</bioact> activity of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant> against <cell>HCT-116</cell>.

Furthermore, <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, could be partly responsible for the free radical scavenging activity of <plant>Premna nauseosa</plant>..
