The <compound>dichloromethane</compound> extracts of the <plantpart>leaves</plantpart> of <plant>Brassica juncea</plant> (mustard) and the <plantpart>roots</plantpart> of <plant>Raphanus sativus</plant> (radish) yielded <compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound>, and the <compound>essential fatty acids</compound>, <compound>Linoleic acid</compound>, and <compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound> .

The presence of <compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound> in the <compound>triglyceride</compound> was deduced from the methyl triplet at 0.96 (t, J = <compound>lutein</compound>, Hz), the double allylic methylenes at <compound>triglycerides</compound>, 78 and the olefinic protons at <compound>trilinolenin</compound>, 34 (m).

Based on integrations of the <compound>triglyceride</compound> methyls at 0.96 (t, J = <compound>lutein</compound>, Hz) and 0.86 (t, J = <compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound>, Hz), the ratio of <compound>linolenic acid</compound> and <compound>linoleic acid</compound> in the <compound>triglycerides</compound> of red cabbage and radish is about 1:1. On the other <bodypart>hand</bodypart>, the <compound>triglyceride</compound> in mustard is <compound>trilinolenin</compound> based on the methyl resonance at 0.96 (t, J = <compound>lutein</compound>, Hz).

No other methyl resonance in the shielded region of the spectrum was detected for the <compound>triglyceride</compound> in mustard.

A mixture of <compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound> and <compound>linoleic acid</compound> in a 1:1 ratio was deduced from the integrals of the methyl triplets at 0.96 (t, J = <compound>lutein</compound>, Hz) and 0.86 (t, J = <compound>lutein</compound>, Hz) for the <compound>fatty acids</compound> in red cabbage and radish.

Although no biological activity tests were conducted on the isolated compounds, literature search revealed that these have several known bioactivities.

<compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound> is interesting to note that <compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound>, <compound>triglycerides</compound>, <compound>stigmasterol</compound>, <compound>Linoleic acid</compound>, <compound>trilinolenin</compound>, <compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound>, <compound>lutein</compound>, were all reported as <bioact>anticancer</bioact> compounds.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> was observed to have growth inhibitory effects on human <bodypart>breast</bodypart> <cell>MCF-7</cell> and MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> was shown to be effective for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> was also reported to attenuate <compound>beta-catenin</compound> and PCNA expression, as well as quench radical in-vitro, making <compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> a potential <bioact>anticancer</bioact> drug for colon carcinogenesis.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> can inhibit the expression of NPC1L1 in the enterocytes to reduce intestinal cholesterol uptake.

<compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound> was reported to induce apoptosis mediated by the activation of ERK and the downregulation of Akt in MCA-102 <compound>murine</compound> fibrosarcoma cells.

On the other <bodypart>hand</bodypart>, <compound>stigmasterol</compound> shows therapeutic efficacy against <cell>Ehrlich</cell> ascites carcinoma bearing mice while conferring protection against cancer induced altered physiological conditions.

A <compound>triglyceride</compound>, <compound>trilinolein</compound> exhibited protective effects against cardiovascular disorders.

<compound>triglyceride</compound> also inhibits ischemiainduced ventricular arrhythmias and <compound>triglyceride</compound> exhibits anti-oxidant effect.

<compound>triglyceride</compound> was also reported to inhibit the growth of human non-small cell lung carcinoma <cell>A549</cell> and induce apoptosis in a doseand timedependent manner.

Another study reported that <compound>triglycerides</compound> showed a direct relationship between toxicity and increasing unsaturation, which in turn correlated with increasing susceptibility to oxidation.

<compound>Trilinolenin</compound> (18:3; -3) was toxic only after prolonged incubation.

<compound>Linoleic acid</compound> belongs to the <compound>omega-6 fatty acids</compound>.

<compound>Linoleic acid</compound> was reported to be a strong anticarcinogen in a number of animal models.

<compound>Linoleic acid</compound> reduces risk of colon and <bodypart>breast</bodypart> cancer and lowers cardiovascular disease risk and inflammations.

Omega-3 <compound>polyunsaturated fatty acids</compound> (n-3 PUFA), <compound>eicosapentaenoic acid</compound> (EPA), <compound>docosahexaenoic acid</compound> (DHA) and <compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound> (ALA) , and <compound>their fatty acid ethyl esters</compound>, exhibited strong <bioact>antibacterial</bioact> activity against various oral pathogens, including <plant>Streptococcus mutans</plant>, <plant>Candida albicans</plant>, <plant>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</plant>, <plant>Fusobacterium nucleatum</plant>, and <plant>Porphyromonas gingivalis</plant>.

They also showed <bioact>anti-inflammatory</bioact> effects.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition serve as two signaling pathways for the inhibitory effects of <compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound> (ALA) on the human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell proliferation.

Another study reported that apoptosis of hepatoma cells was induced by the <compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound>enriched diet which correlated with a decrease in <compound>arachidonate</compound> content in hepatoma cells and decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression.

<compound>Gamma-Linolenic acid</compound> (GLA) and <compound>alpha-linolenic acid</compound> (ALA) exhibited greater than 90% cytotoxicity between 500 M and <compound>Beta-Sitosterol</compound>, mM against all but two malignant micro-organ cultures tested in 5-10% serum.

GLA and ALA killed tumor at concentrations of <compound>triglycerides</compound>, mM and above in tests using 30-40% serum.

Dietary <compound>lutein</compound> , especially at 0.002%, inhibited tumor growth by selectively modulating apoptosis, and by inhibiting angiogenesis.

Another study reported that the chemopreventive properties of all-trans <compound>retinoic acid</compound> (ATRA) and <compound>lutein</compound> may be attributed to their differential effects on apoptosis pathways in normal versus transformed mammary cells.

A previous study reported that very low amounts of dietary <compound>lutein</compound> (0.002%) can efficiently decrease mammary tumor development and growth in mice.

<compound>Beta-carotene</compound> dose-dependently induced apoptosis and cell differentiation in cultured leukemia cells, but not in normal cells.

Another study reported that <compound>beta-carotene</compound> could reduce damage caused by radiation therapy and decrease local cancer recurrence.

<compound>beta-carotene</compound> also inhibited angiogenesis by altering the <compound>cytokine</compound> profile and the activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors.

The <compound>dichloromethane</compound> extracts of Brassica vegetables (red cabbage, green cabbage, broccoli and mustard) and radish afforded similar major constituents: <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, unsaturated <compound>triglycerides</compound> and <compound>essential fatty acids</compound> (linoleic and linolenic acids) which were reported to exhibit <bioact>anticancer</bioact> properties.

Thus, the <bioact>anticancer</bioact> properties of Brassica vegetables and radish are not only attributed to the high content of glucosinolates, but also to the presence of <class>sterols</class>, unsaturated <compound>triglycerides</compound> and <compound>essential fatty acids</compound>.
