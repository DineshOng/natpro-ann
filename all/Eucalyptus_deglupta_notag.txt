Eucalyptus deglupta (Blume) of the family Myrtaceae, commonly known as Mindanao gum or rainbow eucalyptus, is native to the Philippines and other western Pacific islands, adapting well in lowland humid tropical conditions and reaching up to 100 ft in height.

Eucalyptus deglupta is cultivated throughout the world as an ornamental tree, noted for its spectrum of colors developed by the peeling of its smooth bark in a fatigueinspired pattern, revealing multi-colored streaks of yellow, red, blue, orange, green, purple, brown, and gray shades 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, 2]. The genus Eucalyptus has been a traditional source of timber, cellulose-related products and essential oils from the leaves [3, 4]. An antihypertensive food and food additive containing an extract prepared from eucalyptus plants was reported.

Essential oils from the leaves of Eucalyptus deglupta and other related aromatic plants were reported to inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Eucalyptus deglupta was reported to exhibit a high percentage of xanthine oxidase inhibition (IC50 of 44.5 g/mL) and also prevented cataract development in streptozotocin diabetic rats.

A review on the chemical constituents and biological activities of the genus Eucalyptus has been provided.

More than two hundred nonvolatile compounds from this genus have been characterized for their chemical structures and biological activities.

Phloroglucinol derivatives from Eucalyptus have growth regulatory, antigranulation, antiinflammatory and antimalarial activities, while rutin and other flavonoids, terpenoids and tannins from Eucalyptus are of great pharmaceutical importance.

The essential oils from the dried leaves of five species of the genus Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus deglupta, Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus torelliana, Eucalyptus urophylla) were found to contain as major components the following terpenes: alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, limonene, -terpinene, p-cymene and beta-caryophyllene.

Another study reported that the steam-volatile portion of Eucalyptus deglupta yielded 40% terpene fraction which contained ()-alpha-pinene, (-)-alpha-phellandrene, p-cymene, ocimene, isovaleraldehyde, (-)-carvotanacetone, and (+) -nerolidol.

Moreover, the leaf essential oil of Eucalyptus deglupta is mainly composed of sesquiterpenoids (48%), of which E-nerolidol was the major component (34.8%).

Another study reported the isolation of tritriacontane-16,18-dione, 8-methoxyellagic acid-2rhamnoside, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins from the extracts of the wood and bark of Eucalyptus deglupta.

The extracts also afforded a low molecular weight Si containing compound which is effective in inhibiting HIV-1 virus.

The Si containing substance is manufactured by hot water extraction of Eucalyptus deglupta followed by gel filtration.

The isolation of ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, and squalene from the leaves and twigs and nerolidol from the leaves of Eucalyptus deglupta have been reported.

We report herein the isolation and structure elucidation of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8dimethylflavone from the twigs of Eucalyptus deglupta.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the isolation of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, from Eucalyptus deglupta.

Sample Collection Samples of leaves and twigs of Eucalyptus deglupta (Blume) were a generous gift collected from the Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL), Silang, Cavite in May 2014.

The samples were authenticated at the Botany Division of the National Museum, Manila, Philippines and deposited with voucher # 268-2014.

General Isolation Procedure A glass column 20 inches in height and 2.0 inches internal diameter was packed with silica gel.

The crude extract from the leaves were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in dichloromethane (10% increment) as eluents.

One hundred milliliter fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the rechromatography.

Five milliliter fractions were collected.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns.

One milliliter fractions were collected.

Isolation The air-dried twigs of Eucalyptus deglupta (173 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then filtered.

The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (18 g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment.

The 30% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (3 ) in 20% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, (7 mg) after washing with petroleum ether, followed by Et2O.

Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the twigs of Eucalyptus deglupta (Blume) led to the isolation of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone .

The structure of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, was elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy as follows.

The 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, H NMR spectrum of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, indicated resonances for two aromatic methyl singlets at 2.20 and 2.38; methoxy groups at 3.78 and 3.88; a deshielded olefinic proton singlet at 6.61; aromatic proton doublets at 7.02 (2H) and 7.86 (2H) othro coupled to each other by 9 Hz which was confirmed by COSY; and a chelated OH at 12.

The 13 C NMR spectrum of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, gave resonances for a conjugated carbonyl carbon at 183.27; oxygenated aromatic carbons at 163.88, 162.58 (2C), 157.29 and 153.00; protonated aromatic carbons at 128.00 (2C), 114.56 (2C) and 104.09; four non-protonated aromatic carbons at 123,9, 114.10, 108.78 and 107.40; methoxy carbons at 60.51 and 55.53; and methyl carbons at 8.57 and 8.

27.

These resonances indicated a flavone with a hydroxyl, two methoxy and two methyl subtituents.

The protons attached to carbon atoms were assigned from HSQC 2D NMR data (see experimental), and the structure of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, was elucidated by analysis of the HMBC 2D NMR data.

Key HMBC correlations are shown in Fig..

The ortho coupled protons could only be in ring C of the flavone skeleton at C-2', C-3', C-5' and C-6', while the chelated hydroxyl could only be attached to C-5. One of the methoxy groups was attached to C4' on the basis of long-range correlations between this methoxy, the ortho aromatic protons and C-4'. The position of the hydroxyl proton was confirmed by correlations with C-5, C-6 and C-10.

One of the methyl groups was attached to C-6 due to long-range correlations between this methyl and C-6, C-5 and C-7. The second methoxy group was attached to C-7 based on long-range correlations between this methoxy and C-7. The second methyl group was attached to C-8 since long-range correlations were observed between this ISSN: 0975-8585 March - April 2015 RJPBCS 6 Page No. methyl and C-8, C-7 and C-9. The carbonyl was assigned to C-4 on the basis of long-range correlations between the H-3 olefinic proton singlet and this carbon.

All long-range correlations observed were consistent with the structure of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, The structure of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, was confirmed by positive ESI-MS which gave an [M+H] + = 327.18 corresponding to the molecular formula of C19H19O5.

O OCH3 CH3 H3CO H3C OH O Figure 1: HMBC correlations of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, The positions of the methyl and methoxy groups were confirmed by NOESY spectrum (Fig. ). One of the methoxy groups was close in space to two methyl groups in ring A. The olefinic proton singlet in ring C was close to the more deshielded aromatic proton doublet in ring B, which was in turn close to the relatively more shielded aromatic proton doublet, which was finally close to the second methoxy group.

These confirm the positions of the methyl and methoxy groups in 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, O OCH3 CH3 H3CO H3C OH O Figure 2: NOESY correlations of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, Literature search revealed that 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone has been previously isolated from the leaves of Callistemon lanceolatus.

The structure of this compound was determined by MS and 13 C NMR spectroscopy.

However, the 13 C NMR resonances in the literature do not match with our 13 C NMR data and assignments which were based on extensive 1D ( 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone, H and 13 C) and 2D (COSY, HSQC, HMBC and NOESY) NMR spectroscopy..
