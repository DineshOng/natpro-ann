Article history: Received on: 06/05/2015 Revised on: 19/06/2015 Accepted on: 16/07/2015 Available online: 04/09/2015 Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extracts of Cordia dichotoma G. Forst led to the isolation of betasitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate , nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester , beta-sitosterol , and chlorophyll a from the leaves; and Chlorophyll, and 1,2-dilinoleoyl-3-linolenoylglycerol from the twigs.

The structures of Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester, Beta-Sitosterol, Chlorophyll, triacylglycerol, were identified by comparison of their NMR data with those reported in the literature.

The fatty acids in Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester, and triacylglycerol, were deduced from ESI-MS data.

Key words: Cordia dichotoma G. Forst, Boraginaceae, betasitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside'-O-palmitate, nervonyl 4hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester, beta-sitosterol, chlorophyll a, 1,2dilinoleoyl-3linolenoylglycerol.

Cordia dichotoma G. Forst belongs to the family Boraginaceae.

This medium sized tree grows widespread in the Philippines where it is locally known as anonang.

anonang yields edible fruits from which a very sticky white substance could be extracted for gluing purposes.

The leaves, fruit, bark and seed have been reported to exhibit antidiabetic, antiulcer, antiinflammatory, immune-modulator and analgesic activities.

The leaves, seed, fruit, bark, and roots are well-known to have different medicinal uses: antidiabetic, anthelmintic, antilarvicidal, hepatoprotective, immunomodulator, antidysentery, antidyspepsia, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, diuretic and laxative.

The crude ethanol extract from the leaves showed antilarvicidal potency against the brine shrimp Artemia salina.

Email: consolacion.ragasa@dlsu.edu.ph indicated potential antioxidant properties based on direct measurement of radical scavenging activity of crude extracts from the tree's bark.

Crude methanolic extract of the bark showed inhibition of number of implants in laboratory female rats.

In a related study, leaf extract from the tree showed anti-implantation activity, suggesting its possible use as a natural contraceptive drug (Bhattacharya and Saha, 2013).

The fruit, leaves and seed contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, saponins, terpenes and sterols.

Taxifolin from the seeds of Cordia dichotoma showed promising DPPH free radical scavenging activity at a concentration of 100 g/mL.

Another study reported that apigenin triacylglycerol, mg/kg, p.o.) from Cordia dichotoma showed significant healing and reduction in inflammatory enzymes when screened for ulcerative colitis.

The fatty oil content in the seeds of Cordia dichotoma was found to be 7.60% with stearic, oleic and linoleic acids as the major constituents.

Three flavonoids, kaempferol, quercetin and isorhamnetin, were isolated from the butanol fraction of fruits of Cordia dichotoma.

Ragasa et al. / Journal of Applied Pharmaceutical Science triacylglycerol, (Suppl nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester, ; 2015: 016-021 017 Six flavonol glycosides and two phenolic compounds were isolated from butanol extract of the leaves of Cordia dichotoma with rosmarinic acid as a major constituent.

In another study, the ethanolic extracts were reported to contain polyphenolic compounds Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, 0%), triterpenoids (0.075%), amino acids Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, 39%), and rosmarinic acid (0.0028%).

Twodimensional NMR experiments recorded included gCOSY, HSQCAD, and gHMBCAD NMR experiments.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Mass spectral analysis was conducted on the Bruker Daltonics micro TOF Q - II mass spectrometer employing ESI - Qq - TOF in positive mode.

Data analysis was processed using the Bruker Compass Data Analysis Chlorophyll, 0 application.

Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Sample Collection Samples of leaves and twigs of Cordia dichotoma G. Forst were collected from the De La Salle University - Science and Technology Complex (DLSU-STC) riparian forest in February 2014.

The samples were authenticated by one of the authors (EHM) and deposited at the De La Salle University Herbarium with voucher specimen # 916.

General Isolation Procedure The air-dried leaves (300 g) and stems (121 Chlorophyll, g) of Cordia dichotoma were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for three days and then filtered.

The filtrates were concentrated under vacuum to afford crude extracts of leaves (6 Beta-Sitosterol, g), and stems Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, 0 g) which were each chromatographed by gradient elution with CH2Cl2, followed by increasing amounts of acetone at 10% increment by volume as eluents.

A glass column 12 inches in height and 0 triacylglycerol, inch internal diameter was used for the fractionation of crude extracts.

Two milliliter fractions were collected.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

Subsequent chromatography and final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns.

One milliliter fractions were collected.

2015: 016-021 Although no biological activity tests were conducted on the isolated compounds, a literature search of Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester, Beta-Sitosterol, Chlorophyll, revealed that these have diverse bioactivities.

Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate was reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against Bowes (melanoma) and MCF7 (breast) cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 152 M and 113 M, respectively.

Furthermore, Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, exhibited cytotoxicity against human stomach adenocarcinoma (AGS) cell line with 60.28% growth inhibition.

In search of substances that inhibit the hemolytic activity of human serum against erythrocytes, Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, was evaluated on its anticomplement activity.

Compound Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, was found to exhibit potent anti-complement activity (IC50 = Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, 0 0. M) on the classical pathway of the complement, as compared to the positive control, tiliroside (IC50 = 76 triacylglycerol, Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, M).

A study reported that alkyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester compounds: docosyl and tetracosyl 4-hydroxy-transcinnamate caused NUGC cells to survive 67% on treatment with 50 M.

Furthermore, in the superoxide scavenging activity, alkyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester compounds: 1-tetradecyl 4-hydroxycinnamate and 1-eicosanyl 4hydroxycinnamate exhibited IC50 values of 416 M and 477 M, respectively.

In the DPPH radical scavenging activity, both compounds gave IC50 values of >100 M.

Beta-Sitosterol was observed to have growth inhibitory effects on human breast MCF-7 and MDA-MB231adenocarcinoma cells.

Beta-Sitosterol was shown to be effective for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Beta-Sitosterol was also reported to attenuate betacatenin and PCNA expression, as well as quench radical in-vitro, making Beta-Sitosterol a potential anticancer drug for colon carcinogenesis.

Beta-Sitosterol can inhibit the expression of NPC1L1 in the enterocytes to reduce intestinal cholesterol uptake.

Beta-Sitosterol was reported to induce apoptosis mediated by the activation of ERK and the downregulation of Akt in MCA-102 murine fibrosarcoma cells.

Chlorophyll and its various derivatives are used in traditional medicine and for therapeutic purposes.

Natural chlorophyll and its derivatives have been studied for wound healing , anti-inflammatory properties (Larato and Pfao, 1970), control of calcium oxalate crystals , utilization as effective agents in photodynamic cancer therapy (Sternberg et al., 1998; Nourse et al., 1988; Henderson et al., 1997), and chemopreventive effects in humans (Egner et al., 2001; Egner et al., 2003).

A review on digestion, absorption and cancer preventive activity of dietary chlorophyll has been provided (Ferruzzi and Blakeslee, 2007)..

Cordia dichotoma is a medicinal tree with many reported biological activities.

This study reports on the isolation of compounds (Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester, Beta-Sitosterol, Chlorophyll, triacylglycerol, ) from the dichloromethane extracts of the leaves and stems of Cordia dichotoma.

Compounds 14 have been reported to possess anticancer and cytotoxic properties.

The antioxidant property of nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester, cholesterol lowering effect of Beta-Sitosterol, and wound healing effect of Chlorophyll, have also been reported.

Thus, the medicinal properties of Cordia dichotoma maybe partly attributed to Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate, nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester, Beta-Sitosterol, Chlorophyll, which were reported to exhibit diverse biological activities..
