. In an earlier study, we isolated alpha-mangostin as the major xanthone and 3-isomangostin as a minor constituent of the pulp of the ripe fruit of Garcinia mangostana Linn.

Further study on the pulp has led to the isolation of garcinone D.

The structure of Garcinone D, was elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy.

Garcinone Das reported to exhibit anticancer property.

. Garcinia mangostana Linn., the queen of fruits and commonly known as mangosteen, is a natural source of xanthones which are antioxidants, anti-inflammatory [Garcinone D, ], antifungal , and are also used for chemoprevention.

Extracts and xanthones isolated from Garcinia mangostana have antioxidant, antitumor, anti-allergic, antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties.

189 Scholar Research Library We earlier reported the isolation of alpha-mangostin, gartanin and 3-isomangostin from the pericarp of Garcinia mangostin.

Recently, we reported the isolation of -tocotrienol, alpha-mangostin, 3-isomangostin, stigmasterol, triacylglycerols, betasitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters, and stigmasteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters from the pulp; and stigmasterol, triacylglycerols, and linoleic acid from the seeds of Garcinia mangostana.

This study reports on the isolation of garcinone D from the dichloromethane extract of the pulp of the freeze-dried ripe fruit of Garcinia mangostana.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedure NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed, with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Thin layer chromatography, was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Sample Collection Garcinia mangostana Linn fruit was collected from Davao, Philippines in October 2015.

The fruit was authenticated at the Botany Division, Philippine National Museum.

General Isolation Procedure A glass column 18 inches in height and Garcinone D, inch internal diameter was used for the fractionation of the crude extracts.

Eleven 20 mL fractions were collected.

A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the rechromatography of fractions from the crude extracts. mL fractions were collected.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

Rechromatography and final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. mL fractions were collected.

Isolation of Garcinone Dhe freeze-dried pulp (143.3 g) of Garcinia mangostana was ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for three days and then filtered.

The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to afford a crude extract Garcinone D, 96 g) which was chromatographed by gradient elution with CH2Cl2, followed by increasing amounts of acetone at 10% increment by volume as eluents.

The 60% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (4 ) using CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (2:2:6, v/v) to afford Garcinone D, (3 mg) after trituration with petroleum ether.

Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the freeze-dried pulp of the ripe fruit of Garcinia mangostana has led to the isolation of garcinone D.

The structure of Garcinone D, was elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy.

Compound Garcinone D, indicated similar 1H NMR resonances to alpha-mangostin.

The differences were the non-appearance of the benzylic methylene protons of the prenyl group attached to ring B at 4.07 (H2-1'') in alphamangostin and the appearance of more overlapping benzylic methylene protons at 3.41 in Garcinone D, Furthermore, the vinylic proton at 5.26 (H-2'') in alpha-mangostin was replaced by methylene protons at Garcinone D, 78 in Garcinone D, The allylic methyl groups at Garcinone D, 67 (H3-4'') and Garcinone D, 82 (H3-5'') in alpha-mangostin were replaced by two overlapping methyl singlets at Garcinone D, 31 in Garcinone D, These relatively deshielded methyl singlets suggested that they were bonded to a hydroxylated quaternary carbon.

The change from a prenyl group with a double bond attached to ring B of alpha-mangostin to a hydroxylated prenyl group in Garcinone D, was supported by the 13C NMR spectrum of Garcinone D, The benzylic methylene carbon of the prenyl group attached to ring B of alpha-mangostin at 26.6 (C-1'') was shielded to 21.4 in Garcinone D, Moreover, the vinylic carbons at 123.5 (C-2'') and 132.2 (C-3'') in alpha-mangostin were shielded to 44.4 and 70.8, respectively in Garcinone D, The 1H and 13C NMR assignments of Garcinone D, in CDCl are given (see experimental).

The protons bonded to carbons were deduced from HSQC.

The structure of Garcinone D, was further supported by isolated spin systems from COSY and long-range correlations Consolacion Y Ragasa et al Der Pharmacia Lettre, 2016, 8 (20):188-190.

Previous literature reported the 1H and 13C NMR data of Garcinone D, in acetone-d6 , DMSO-d6 , and CD3OD.

However, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the 1H and 13C NMR data of Garcinone D, in CDCl.

Garcinone D exhibited cytotoxicity against the HT-29 cell line with an ED50 value of 2. M and in an ELISA NF-B assay, Garcinone D, inhibited p65 activation with an IC50 value of 3. M.

Garcinone D showed significant activity against CEM-SS cell line with an IC50 value of 3.2 g/mL.

Garcinone D was found to possess inhibitory activity using a cell free, enzyme-based microsomal aromatase inhibition assay.

Furthermore, SKBR breast cancer cells which are known to express high levels of aromatase were found to be inhibited by Garcinone D,

Garcinone Disolated from the young fruit (7 weeks maturity) of Garcinia mangostana was also shown to exhibit cytotoxicity against epidermal carcinoma of the mouth (KB), breast cancer (BC-1), and small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) with IC50 values of 3.56, 2.81 and 11.04 g/mL, respectively.
