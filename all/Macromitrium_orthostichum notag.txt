Macromitrium Brid is a large genus of pantropical mosses consisting of xerophytic epiphytes.

One member of this genus, Macromitrium orthostichum Nees ex Schwgr is restricted in Southeast Asia up to Papua New Guinea was recorded in Luzon, Mindoro and Mindanao islands in the Philippines.

Like other members of Macromitrium, this species is distinguished from other mosses by having creeping prostrate stems that give rise to rigid branches that terminate into sporophytes.

The plant of Macromitrium orthostichum, as in most members of Macromitrium, have some shades of reddish brown with leaves variously twisted and contorted around the branches.

Macromitrium orthostichum differs from other Macromitrium species by having papillose rhizoids arising along the basal leaf margins.

There is no report on the chemical constituents and biological activities of Macromitrium orthostichum.

Herein, the isolation of zeorin , atranorin and a mixture of beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol (Fig. ) from the dichloromethane extract of Macromitrium orthostichum is reported.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of compounds zeorin, atranorin, Beta-Sitosterol, stigmasterol, from Macromitrium orthostichum.

EXPERIMENTAL NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Sample collection: The Philippine specimen chosen for present investigation was gathered from a tree branch on a mossy forest at Mount Natib's Peak, Morong, Bataan, Philippines on 19th December 2017.

The specimen was collected and authenticated as Macromitrium orthostichum Nees ex Schwgr by one of the authors (VCL).

General isolation procedure: A glass column 12 inches in height with 0.5 inches in internal diameter was used for the fractionation of the crude extract.

Fractions of 10 mL volumes were collected and monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions containing spots with similar Rf values were combined and rechromatographed using the appropriate solvent.

Final purification was carried out using Pasteur pipette as the column, collecting zeorin, mL fractions.

TLC-pure isolates were combined, and after evaporation of the solvent were subjected to NMR analysis.

Isolation of chemical constituents of Macromitrium orthostichum: The freeze-dried Macromitrium orthostichum (17.81 g) was ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for three days and then filtered.

The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (0.1723 g) which was chromatographed by gradient elution using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10 % increment.

The fraction eluted with 40 % acetone in CH2Cl2 was rechromatographed using 10 % EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford a mixture of compounds Beta-Sitosterol, and stigmasterol, atranorin, mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 50 % acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using 15 % EtOAc in petroleum ether, followed by CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (0.5:0.5:9, v/v).

The fractions eluted with 15 % ethyl acetate in petroleum ether were combined and rechromatographed using the same solvent to afford compound zeorin, (0.7 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The fractions eluted with CH3CN:Et2O: CH2Cl2 (0.5:0.5:9, v/v) was rechromatographed using the same solvent to yield compound atranorin, (0 Beta-Sitosterol, mg) after washing with petroleum ether.
