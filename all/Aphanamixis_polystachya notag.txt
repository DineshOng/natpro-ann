. The dichloromethane extract of the air-dried leaves of Aphanamixis polystachya Wall Parker afforded alpha-copaene , squalene , polyprenol , beta-sitosterol , lutein , and beta-carotene .

The structure of alphacopaene, was elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by mass spectrometry.

Key words: Aphanamixis polystachya, Meliaceae, alpha-copaene, squalene, polyprenol, beta-sitosterol, lutein, beta-carotene.

. Aphanamixis polystachya Wall Parker of the family Meliaceae is a native of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and the Province of China.

The bark of Aphanamixis polystachya was reported to exhibit antioxidant , antitumor , and radioprotective properties.

Furthermore, the bark showed antifeedant and repellant properties as well as toxicity against the red flour beetle.

Aphanamixis polystachya leaf extracts exhibited antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antioxidant activities.

A number of studies have been conducted on the chemical constituents of the different parts of Aphanamixis polystachya which reported the isolation of diterpenes , limonoids [8-15], lignans , flavonoid glycosides and a chromone , triterpenes [18, 19], sesquiterpenes , and alkaloids.

We report herein the isolation and structure elucidation of alpha-copaene , and the isolation and identification of squalene , polyprenol , beta-sitosterol , lutein , and beta-carotene (Fig. ) from the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of Aphanamixis polystachya.

This is the first report on the isolation of alphacopaene, from Aphanamixis polystachya.

Chemical Constituents of Aphanamixis polystachya: alpha-copaene , squalene , polyprenol , beta-sitosterol , lutein , and betacarotene EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures HREIMS was obtained on a Finnigan MAT 95S mass spectrometer.

NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova spectrometer in CDCl at 500 MHz for 1H NMR and 125 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

67 was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh), while the TLC was performed with plastic-backed plates coated with silica gel F254.

The plates were visualized with vanillin-H2SO4 and warming.

A glass column (18 inches in height and alphacopaene, 0 inch internal diameter) was packed with silica gel.

The crude extract was fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in dichloromethane (10 % increments) as eluents. mL fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed.

A glass column (12 inches in height and 0 lutein, inch internal diameter) was used for the rechromatography. mL fractions were collected.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. mL fractions were collected.

Sample Collection Leaf samples of Aphanamixis polystachya were collected from Bacnotan, La Union, Philippines in March 2013.

Aphanamixis polystachya was authenticated at the Jose Vera Santos Herbarium, Institute of Biology, University of the Philippines, Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines where a voucher specimen was deposited with accession number 14669.

Isolation of Constituents from the Leaves of Aphanamixis polystachya The air-dried leaves alphacopaene, kg) of Aphanamixis polystachya were soaked in CH2Cl2 for three days, and then filtered.

The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to afford the crude extract (49 g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10 % increments by volume as eluents.

The CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using petroleum ether as eluent to afford alphacopaene, (35 mg).

The 10 % acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction from the chromatography of the crude extract was rechromatographed in petroleum ether to afford squalene, (15 mg) and beta-carotene, (12 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 20 % acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed in 10 % EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford polyprenol, (10 mg).

The 30 % acetone in dichloromethane fraction was rechromatographed in 15 % EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford beta-sitosterol, lutein, mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 40 % to 60 % acetone in CH2Cl2 fractions were combined and rechromatographed in CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (0.5:0.5:9 by volume) to afford lutein, (28 mg) after washing with petroleum ether, followed by diethyl ether.

Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of Aphanamixis polystachya Wall Parker afforded alphacopaene , squalene , polyprenol , beta-sitosterol , lutein , and beta-carotene .

The structure of alphacopaene, was elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by mass spectrometry.

Furthermore, alphacopaene, gave similar 13C NMR resonances with those reported in the literature for alpha-copaene.

The structures of squalene , polyprenol , beta-sitosterol , lutein , and beta-carotene were identified by comparison of their 1H and/or 13C NMR data with those reported in the literature..
