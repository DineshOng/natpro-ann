The dichloromethane extract of Samanea saman afforded epilupeol , lupenone and chlorophyll a from the leaves; lupenone, and lupeol from the peduncle; and Lupeol, unsaturated triglycerides , alpha-spinasterol , and alphaspinasterone from the twigs.

The structures of epilupeol, lupenone, chlorophyll a, Lupeol, triglycerides, Alpha-Spinasterol, were identified by comparison of their epilupeol, H and/or 13 C NMR data with those reported in the literature.

Samanea saman Jacq Merr of the family Fabaceae is commonly known as acacia or rain tree.

In the Philippines, it is widely planted as a shade tree.

A decoction of the bark and leaves is used to treat diarrhea, acute bacillary dysentery, enteritis, colds, sore throat and headache.

A decoction of fresh material is applied as external wash for anaphylactic dermatitis, eczema, skin pruritus.

Samanea saman was reported to exhibit potent antimicrobial, molluscicidal, nematicidal, hemolytic, and hypercholesterolemic properties.

Literature search on the chemical constituents of Samanea saman revealed the presence of octacosanol, alpha-spinasterol, beta-Dglucose of alpha-spinasterol, kaempferol and pithecolobine from the different parts of the tree.

The volatile constituents of Samanea saman have been reported with palmitic acid (55.5%), epilupeol, 8-cineole (15.9%), and oleic acid alpha-spinasterone, 4%) as the major constituents lupenone, Lupeol, . Another study reported the isolation of lupeol and epilupeol from the whole plant of Samanea saman.

This study was conducted as part of our research on the chemical constituents of trees found at the De La Salle UniversityManila campus.

We earlier reported the chemical constituents of Barringtonia asiatica [Alpha-Spinasterol, alpha-spinasterone, ], Alstonia scholaris , Pterocarpus indicus [9-10], and Swietenia macrophylla.

In this study, the isolation and identification of epilupeol , lupenone and chlorophyll a from the leaves; lupenone, and lupeol from the peduncle; and Lupeol, unsaturated triglycerides , spinasterol , and spinasterone from the twigs of Samanea saman are reported.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedures NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh), while the TLC was performed with plastic-backed plates coated with silica gel F254.

The plates were visualized with vanillin-H2SO4 and warming.

A glass column (18 inches in height and epilupeol, 0 inch internal diameter) was packed with silica gel.

The crude extract was fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in dichloromethane (10 % increments) as eluents. mL fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed.

A glass column (12 inches in height and 0 triglycerides, inch internal diameter) was used for the rechromatography. mL fractions were collected.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. mL fractions were collected.

Sample Collection The sample was collected from the De La Salle University-Manila Campus in July 2013.

Isolation of Chemical Constituents The air-dried leaves (264 g), petioles (43 g) and twigs (165 g) of Samanea saman were separately ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for three days and then filtered to afford crude extracts: leaves Lupeol, 34 g), petioles (0.42 g) and stems epilupeol, 56 g).

The crude extracts were separately fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in dichloromethane (10 % increments) as eluents.

The dichloromethane extract of Samanea saman afforded epilupeol , lupenone and chlorophyll a from the leaves; lupenone, and lupeol from the peduncles; and Lupeol, unsaturated triglycerides , alpha-spinasterol , and alpha-spinasterone from the twigs.

The structures of epilupeol, lupenone, chlorophyll a, Lupeol, triglycerides, Alpha-Spinasterol, alpha-spinasterone, were identified by comparison of their 1H and/or 13C NMR data with those reported in the literature [12-18]. Although bioassays were not conducted on the isolated compounds, there were previous studies that reported on their biological activities.

A mixture of lupenone and caryophyllene oxide in a 1:4 ratio showed in-vitro typanocydal activity against epimastigotes forms of T. cruzi (IC50 = 10 Lupeol, g/mL, FIC = 0.46).

Triterpene lupenone, from E. multiflora stimulated melanogenesis in B16 murine melanoma cells through the inhibition of ERK1 lupenone, activation, indicating that it can be used as a possible treatment for hypopigmentation diseases.

Lupeol exhibited anticancer activities against pancreatic , prostate [22-23], ovarian , colorectal and myeloma , breast , stomach , cervical [26-28], lymphoma , leukemia [26, 29], melanoma and neuroblastoma , melanoma [25-27, 2930], and lung [25-28, 30] cancers.

Furthermore, Lupeol, was also found to exhibit antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , and anti-arthritic [33-34] properties.

Alpha-Spinasterol exhibited antiproliferative action against CACO-2 cell line with IC50 value of 60 nM/ml.

Moreover, Alpha-Spinasterol, has significant therapeutic potential to modulate the development and/or progression of diabetic nephropathy.

Alpha-Spinasterol was also found to exhibit antiangiogenic potential.

Alpha-Spinasterol was also reported to exhibit antioxidative , antinociceptive , anti-inflammatory , anti-ulcerogenic and antitumor effects.
