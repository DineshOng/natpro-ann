. Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br has yielded mixtures of erythrodiol , uvaol , and betulin in a 1:1:1 ratio, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid in a 2:1 ratio, beta-amyrin acetate and alpha-amyrin acetate in a 1:4 ratio, and beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol in a 3:2 ratio; squalene , beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters , and chlorophyll a.

The structures of squalene, beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters, chlorophyll a, were identified by comparison of their NMR data with literature data.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh, Merck).

Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 (Merck) and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

All solvents used are analytical grade.

Sample Collection Samples of Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br leaves were collected from the De La Salle University - Manila campus in October 2015.

The samples were authenticated at the Botany Division, Philippine National Museum.

195 General Isolation Procedure A glass column 12 inches in height and 0 squalene, inch internal diameter was used for the chromatography.

The crude extracts were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment by volume as eluents.

Five milliliter fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns.

One milliliter fractions were collected.

Isolation of the Chemical Constituents from the Leaves of Alstonia scholaris The air-dried Alstonia scholaris leaves (113.21 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then filtered.

The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (1.22 g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 in 10% increments by volume.

The 10% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (2 ) using petroleum ether to yield squalene, (4 mg).

The 20% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (2 ) using petroleum ether to afford a mixture of 3a and 3a):alpha-amyrin acetate, (4 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 30% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (3 ) using 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether to yield chlorophyll a, (3 mg) after washing with petroleum ether, followed by Et2O.

The 40% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using 15% EtOAc in petroleum ether, followed by 20% EtOAc in petroleum ether.

The fractions eluted with 15% EtOAc in petroleum ether were combined and rechromatographed using the same solvent to afford a mixture of beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol, (3 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The fractions eluted with 20% EtOAc in petroleum ether were combined and rechromatographed using the same solvent to yield a mixture of erythrodiol, uvaol, and betulin, squalene, mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 50% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (3 ) using 20% EtOAc in petroleum ether to yield a mixture of oleanolic acid, and 2a):ursolic acid, (3 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 60% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (1:1:8, v/v).

Fractions from this column were combined and rechromatographed using CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (1.5:1.5:7, v/v) to afford beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters, (3 mg) after trituration with petroleum ether..

Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of Alstonia scholaris yielded squalene, beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters, chlorophyll a, . The NMR spectra of erythrodiol, are in accordance with data reported in the literature for erythrodiol ; uvaol, for uvaol ; betulin, for betulin ; oleanolic acid, for oleanolic acid ; 2a):ursolic acid, for ursolic acid ; 3a for beta-amyrin acetate ; 3a):alpha-amyrin acetate, for alpha-amyrin acetate ; beta-sitosterol, for beta-sitosterol ; stigmasterol, for stigmasterol ; squalene, for squalene ; beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters, for beta-sitosteryl-3betaglucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters ; and chlorophyll a, for chlorophyll a

The 1:1:1 ratio of the mixture of :: was deduced from the integrations and intensities of the 1H NMR resonances for the olefinic protons of erythrodiol, at squalene, 17 (t, J = 3. Hz, H-12) , uvaol, at squalene, 12 (t, J = 3. Hz, H-12) , and betulin, at 4.66 (br d, J = 2 Hz, Ha-29) and 4.56 (br s, Hb-29).

The 2:1 ratio of the mixture of oleanolic acid (2a):ursolic acid was deduced from the integrations and intensities of the 1H NMR resonances for the olefinic protons of oleanolic acid, at squalene, 27 (t, J = 3. Hz, H-3) and 2a):ursolic acid, at squalene, 24 (t, J = 3. Hz, H-3).

The 1:4 ratio of the mixture of beta-amyrin acetate (3a):alpha-amyrin acetate was deduced from the integrations and intensities of the 1H NMR resonances for the olefinic protons of 3a at squalene, 15 (t, J = 3. Hz, H-3) and 3a):alpha-amyrin acetate, at squalene, 10 (t, J = 3. Hz, H3).

The presence of the acetate functional groups was deduced from the appearance of methyl singlets at 2.02 and 2.

03.

The integrations of the 1H NMR resonances for the olefinic protons of beta-sitosterol, at squalene, 33 (brd, J = squalene, Hz, H-6) and stigmasterol, at squalene, 33 (brd, J = squalene, Hz, H-6), squalene, 13 (dd, J = 8.4, 15.

Hz, H-22) and squalene, 00 (dd, J = 8.8, 15.

Hz, H-23) suggested that the ratio of beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol, is about 3:2..
