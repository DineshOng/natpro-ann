Cymodocea rotundata is a widespread seagrass that occurs in shallow water, on sand-mud in sheltered coves or bays, lagoons, mouth of rivers and coral reefs throughout the Philippines.

Cymodocea rotundata has a wide IndoPacific distribution and is relatively common within its range.

Cymodocea rotundata extracts exhibited predominant growth inhibitory activity against UTI bacteria and human pathogens.

Phytochemical analysis of Cymodocea rotundata extracts indicated the presence of tannins, saponins, resins, proteins, acidic compounds, reducing sugars, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides and alkaloids.

Another study reported that Cymodocea rotundata contained vitamin C (28.43 mg g-) and p-coumaric acid.

Cymodocea rotundata extracts gave a total antioxidant activity of 6.65 mg ascorbic acid equivalent/g and was found to be a potent DPPH radical scavenger (70.

30%).

This study is part of our research on the chemical constituents of seagrasses found in the Philippines.

We earlier reported the isolation of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, chlorophyll a, beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol from Cymodocea serrulata.

We report herein the isolation of beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-Ofatty acid esters , chlorophyll a and a mixture of beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol from Cymodocea rotundata.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of 1-3b from Cymodocea rotundata.

MATERIALS AND METHODS NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Chemical Constituents of Cymodocea rotundata Asch and Schweinf.

.: Cymodocea rotundata Asch and Schweinf, a widespread seagrass with reported antimicrobial activity, was investigated for its chemical constituents.

Methods: The compounds were isolated by silica gel chromatography and identified by NMR spectroscopy.

Results: This study has led to the isolation of beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters , chlorophyll a and a mixture of beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol in about 1:1 ratio from the dichloromethane extract of Cymodocea rotundata. .: This is the first report on the isolation of 1-3b from Cymodocea rotundata.

Compounds 2-3b were reported to exhibit antibacterial activity and may be partly responsible for the reported antimicrobial activity of the Cymodocea rotundata extract.

Key words: Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodoceaceae, beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-Ofatty acid esters, Chlorophyll , beta-sitosterol, Stigmasterol.

Chemical Constituents of Cymodocea rotundata Asch and Schweinf.

Pharmacog J. 2018;10:620-1. Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/ H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Sample Collection Samples of the leaves of Cymodocea rotundata Asch and Schweinf were collected from the seagrass meadow of Caramoan, Camarines Sur Philippines in September 2016.

The samples were authenticated at the Botany Division, Philippine National Museum.

General Isolation Procedure A glass column 6 inches in height and 0.25 inch internal diameter was used for the chromatography.

The crude extracts were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment by volume as eluents.

Five milliliter fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns.

One milliliter fractions were collected.

Isolation of the Chemical Constituents from the Leaves of Cymodocea rotundata The air-dried Cymodocea rotundata (50 g) leaves were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then filtered.

The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (0.3 g) which was chromatoRagasa et al.: Cymodocea rotundata Pharmacognosy Journal, Vol 10, Issue 4, Jul-Aug, 2018 621 graphed using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment by volume.

The 10% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether.

The less polar fractions were combined and rechromatographed using 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford chlorophyll a, (4 mg) after washing with petroleum ether, followed by Et2O.

The more polar fractions were combined and rechromatographed chlorophyll a, ) using 15% EtOAc in petroleum ether to yield a mixture of Beta-Sitosterol, and stigmasterol, (6 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 60% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (1:1:8, v/v) to afford beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters, (3 mg) after washing with petroleum ether..

Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of Cymodocea rotundata has led to the isolation of beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters , chlorophyll a and a mixture of beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol .

The NMR data of beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters, are in accordance with the data reported in the literature for beta-sitosteryl-3beta-glucopyranoside-6'-O-fatty acid esters;8 chlorophyll a, for chlorophyll a9 Beta-Sitosterol, for beta-sitosterol;10,11 and stigmasterol, for stigmasterol.

Although no biological activity tests were conducted on the isolated compounds, literature search revealed that 2-3b exhibited antibacterial activities.

Chlorophyll and its derivatives were reported to exhibit wound healing properties and antibacterial activities.

Beta-Sitosterol and stigmasterol were also reported to possess antibacterial activities. ,15,16,17.

This is the first report on the isolation of 1-3b from Cymodocea rotundata.

Compounds 2-3b were reported to exhibit antibacterial activity and may be partly responsible for the reported antimicrobial property of the Cymodocea rotundata extract..
