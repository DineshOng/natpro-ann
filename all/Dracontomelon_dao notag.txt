The dao bark is used against dysentery.

The mature fruits and kernel of the seeds are edible, while the flowers and young leaves are eaten as vegetables.

The wood of dao is employed in light construction, timber and firewood.

The EtOAc extract of the leaves of D. dao was observed to exhibit strong antibacterial activity with an IC50 of 98 anacardic acid, g/mL.

The crude methanolic extracts of the leaves, stem and root barks ofD dao exhibited a very good level of broad spectrum antibacterial activity, while the leaf extract exhibited antifungal activity.

The essential oil was extracted from the skins of stem of D. dao by steam distillation.

GCMS analysis identified 13 compounds with the following major components: nhexadecanoic acid (46.13%), octadeca noic acid (15.44%), (E)9octadecenoic acid (13.73%), and (Z,Z9, 12octadecadienoic acid monoacylglycerol,

79%).
