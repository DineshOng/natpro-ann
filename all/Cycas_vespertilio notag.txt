Chemical investigation of Cycas vespertilio male cone led to the isolation of pinoresinol , lariciresinol , mixtures of alpha-amyrin acetate and lupeol acetate in a lariciresinol, 5:1 ratio and beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol in a 2:1 ratio, triglycerides , and fatty alcohols .

The structures of affordedpinoresinol, and lariciresinol, were elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, while those of were identified by comparison of their 1H and/or 13C NMR spectra with those reported in the literature.

Cycas, the only currently known genus of the Family Cycadaceae, are considered as fossil plants.

Their long existence and persistence through time have sparked special interest in their biology and evolution.

The cycads resemble palms in morphology, thus are commonly called sago palm.

These are widely distributed in the Tropics, with species found in Asia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Pacific, and Australia.

They also grow on volcanic, limestone, ultramafic, sandy, or even water-logged soils in grassland and forest habitats.

Of the eleven cycad species in the Philippines, ten are endemic to the country.

Except for our recent paper on the chemical constituents of Cycas sancti-lasallei, there are no reported studies on the chemical constituents of these endemic cycad species.

This study is part of our research on the chemical constituents of Cycas species endemic to the Philippines.

In an earlier study, we reported the isolation of squalene, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and triglycerides from the sarcotesta; beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, triglycerides and phytyl fatty acid esters from the endotesta; beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, triglycerides, and beta-sitosteryl fatty acid esters from the sclerotesta; and triglycerides and beta-sitosteryl fatty acid esters from the bark of Cycas sancti-lasallei.

We report herein the isolation of pinoresinol , lariciresinol , triglycerides , and fatty alcohols from the dichloromethane extract of Cycas vespertilio male cone.

Mixtures of alpha-amyrin acetate and lupeol acetate ; and beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol were also obtained from the dichloromethane extract.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General experimental procedure NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for13 C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Plant material Cycas vespertilio A. Lindstr. & K. D. Hill male cone were collected from Iloilo, Panay Island, Philippines in April 2013.

Voucher specimens were collected and authenticated by one of the authors (EMGA) and deposited in the De La Salle University-Manila Herbarium (DLSUH 3112).

General isolation procedure A glass column 18 inches in height and affordedpinoresinol, 0 inch internal diameter was used for the chromatography of the crude extracts.

Twenty milliliter fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

A glass column 12 inches in height and 0 triglycerides, inch internal diameter was used for the rechromatography of smaller fractions from the first column.

Five milliliter fractions were collected.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns.

One milliliter fractions were collected.

The lariciresinol, 5:1 ratio for the mixture of alpha-amyrin acetate, and lupeol acetate, was deduced from the 1H NMR integrations for the olefinic protons at triglycerides, 10 for alpha-amyrin acetate, and 4.67 and 4.55 for lupeol acetate,

Although no biological activity tests were conducted on the isolated compounds (affordedpinoresinol, lariciresinol, triglycerides, ), a literature search of these compounds revealed thatthese have diverse bioactivities.

Pinoresinol was found to have antioxidant and Ca2+ antagonist properties.

Pinoresinol was reported to exhibit strong antiinflammatory properties by acting on the NF-B signaling pathway.

Furthermore, affordedpinoresinol, attenuates inflammatory responses of microglia and could be useful in modulation of inflammatory status in brain disorders.Lignan 1was shown to possess fungicidal activities and therapeutic potential as an antifungal agent for the treatment of fungal infectious diseases in humans.

affordedpinoresinol exhibited inhibitory activity against rat intestinal maltase with an IC50 value of 34.

M16.

Lariciresinol inhibited the tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis.

In MCF-7 xenografts, lariciresinol, enhanced tumor cell apoptosis and increased estrogen receptor beta expression, indicating the importance of lariciresinol, in theinhibition of breast cancer development.

Furthermore, lariciresinol, inhibited lipid peroxidation and is a good scavenger of superoxide radicals.

Lignan lariciresinol, was also reported to possess fungicidal activities by disrupting the fungal plasma membrane and therapeutic potential as a novel antifungal agent for the treatment of fungal infectious diseases in humans.

The oral administration of alpha-amyrin acetate significantly improved the diabetic condition in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in model type lariciresinol, diabetic mice at 50 mg/kg-1 dose level.

Another study reported that alpha-amyrin acetate, showed sedative, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties.

On the other hand lupeol acetate was reported to exhibit a strong antimicrobial effect against gram positive organisms, but no activity against gram negative bacteria and fungi,23.

Beta-Sitosterol was observed to have growth inhibitory effects on human breast MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells.

Beta-Sitosterol was shown to be effective for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Beta-Sitosterol was also reported to attenuate beta-catenin and PCNA expression, as well as quench radical in vitro, making Beta-Sitosterol a potential anticancer drug for colon carcinogenesis.

Beta-Sitosterol can inhibit the expression of NPC1L1 in the enterocytes to reduce intestinal cholesterol uptake.

Beta-Sitosterol was reported to induce apoptosis mediated by the activation of ERK and the Antonio S. Ng et al. / Secondary Metabolites from IJPPR, Volume 7, Issue 4, August 2015September 2015 Page 730 downregulation of Akt in MCA-102 murine fibrosarcoma cells.

Stigmasterol shows therapeutic efficacy against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma bearing mice while conferring protection against cancer induced altered physiological conditions.

Stigmasterol lowers plasma cholesterol levels, inhibits intestinal cholesterol and plant sterol absorption, and suppresses hepatic cholesterol and classic bile acid synthesis in Winstar as well as WKY rats.

Other studies reported that stigmasterol showed cytostatic activity against Hep-2 and McCoy cells, markedly inhibited tumour promotion in two stage carcinogenesis experiments, exhibited antimutagenic, topical antiinflammatory, antiosteoarthritic and antioxidant activities.

Triacylglycerides exhibited antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, Cycas albicans,and T. mentagrophytes.

Another study reported that triglycerides showed a direct relationship between toxicity and increasing unsaturation, which in turn correlated with increasing susceptibility to oxidation.On the other hand, long-chain fatty alcoholswas reported to exhibit a protective effect on some mediators involved in the inflammatory damage development..

The dichloromethane extracts of Cycas vespertilio, a plant endemic to the Philippines, affordedpinoresinol , lariciresinol , alpha-amyrin acetate , lupeol acetate , beta-sitosterol , stigmasterol , triglycerides , and fatty alcohols .

Compounds affordedpinoresinol, lariciresinol, triglycerides, were reported to exhibit diverse biological activities..
