Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with <compound>vanillin</compound>/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Sample Collection Samples of the <plantpart>flowers</plantpart> of <plant>Duranta erecta</plant> were collected from <loc>Sta Rosa</loc>, <loc>Laguna</loc>, <loc>Plippines</loc> in January 2015.

The samples were authenticated at the Botany Division, Philippine National Museum.

General Isolation Procedure A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the chromatography.

The crude extracts were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of <compound>acetone</compound> in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment by volume as eluents.

Five milliliter fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate Consolacion Y. Ragasa et al Der Pharmacia Lettre, 2016, 8 (19):234-236.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns.

One milliliter fractions were collected.

Isolation of the chemical constituents from the <plantpart>Flowers</plantpart> of <plant>Duranta erecta</plant> The air-dried <plant>Duranta erecta</plant> <plantpart>flowers</plantpart> (70 g) were <prep>ground</prep> in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for <compound>phytyl fatty acid esters</compound>, days and then <prep>filtered</prep>.

The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude <prep>extract</prep> <compound>oleanolic acid</compound>, 86 g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of <compound>acetone</compound> in CH2Cl2 in 10% increments by volume.

The 20% <compound>acetone</compound> in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using 7.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether.

The less polar fractions were combined and rechromatographed using 7.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford <compound>phytyl fatty acid esters</compound>, <compound>triacylglycerols</compound>, mg).

The more polar fractions were combined and rechromatographed using 7.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford <compound>triacylglycerols</compound>, (5 mg).

The 30% <compound>acetone</compound> in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (2 ) using 15% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford a mixture of <compound>alphaamyrin</compound>, and <compound>beta-amyrin</compound>, (6 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 90% <compound>acetone</compound> in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (2 ) using CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (0.5:0.5:9, v/v) to afford <compound>oleanolic acid</compound>, <compound>phytyl fatty acid esters</compound>, mg) after washing with petroleum ether..

Silica gel chromatography of the <compound>dichloromethane</compound> <prep>extract</prep> of the <plantpart>leaves</plantpart> of <plant>Duranta erecta</plant> yielded 1-4b.

The NMR spectra of <compound>oleanolic acid</compound>, are in accordance with data reported in the literature for <compound>olenolic acid</compound> ; <compound>alphaamyrin</compound>, for <compound>alpha-amyrin</compound> ; and <compound>beta-amyrin</compound>, for <compound>betaamyrin</compound> ; <compound>phytyl fatty acid esters</compound>, for <compound>phytyl fatty acid esters</compound> ; and <compound>triacylglycerols</compound>, for <compound>triacylglycerols</compound>.

The 3:1 ratio of the mixture of <compound>alphaamyrin</compound> and <compound>beta-amyrin</compound> was deduced from the integrations and intensities of the 1H NMR resonances for the olefinic protons of <compound>alphaamyrin</compound>, at 5.24 (t, J = <compound>phytyl fatty acid esters</compound>, Hz, H-12) and <compound>beta-amyrin</compound>, at 5.27 (t, J = <compound>phytyl fatty acid esters</compound>, Hz, H-12).
