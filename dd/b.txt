. Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of Artocarpus ovatus Blanco led to the isolation of 3beta-friedelinol , squalene , polyprenol , triacylglycerols , and chlorophyll a.

The structures of beta-Friedelinol, Squalene, Polyprenols, Triacylglycerols, were identified by comparison of their 1H and/or 13C NMR data with those reported in the literature.

. Artocarpus ovatus Blanco, an endemic Philippine tree, produces strong and durable timber which is used for construction [beta-Friedelinol, ]. A latex obtained from the tree has potential for use as a chewing gum base , while the roasted seeds are eaten.

There is no reported study on the chemical constituents of Artocarpus ovatus.

However, congeners of the tree have been studied for their chemical constituents and biological activities.

There are about 50 species of the genus Artocarpus (Moraceae) which are sources of edible fruit and timber and are used in folk medicines.

A review of the chemical constituents, biological and pharmacological activities of Artocarpus has been provided.

Compounds from Artocarpus species exhibit diverse biological activities including antibacterial, antitubercular, antiviral, antifungal, antiplatelet, antiarthritic, tyrosinase inhibitory and cytotoxicity.

Artocarpus species are used for treatment against inflammation, malarial fever, diarrhoea, diabetes and tapeworm infection.

They are rich in phenolic compounds such as flavonoids, stilbenoids, arylbenzofurons and jacalin.

This study is part of our research on the chemical constituents of the genus Artocarpus found in the Philippines.

We earlier reported the isolation of friedelinol, squalene, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol and phytol from the leaves of Artocarpus camansi, while the stems yielded polyprenol, cycloartenol and cycloartenol acetate.

In another study, the leaves of Artocarpus altilis yielded beta-sitosterol, triglycerides, squalene, polyprenol, lutein and fatty acids, while Artocarpus odoratissimus afforded beta-sitosterol, triglycerides and fatty acids from the flesh of the fruit and seeds; and beta-sitosterol, fatty acids and hydrocarbons from the fruit rind.

Furthermore, the unripe fruit of Artocarpus heterophyllus afforded cycloartenone, cycloartenol, and a diastereomeric mixture of Squalene, 3-butanediols.

Recently, we reported the isolation of lupeol, alphaamyrin, beta-amyrin, lupeol fatty acid ester, alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester, beta-myrin fatty acid ester, betulin, 3beta,28dihydroxyolean-12-ene, oleanolic acid, beta-sitosterol, and chlorophyll afrom the twigs of Artocarpus ovatus.

Chemical constituents of Artocarpus ovatus leaves: 3beta-friedelinol , squalene , polyprenol , triacylglycerols , and chlorophyll a MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedure NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Sample Collection The sample was collected from Bataan, Philippines in October 2013.

vanillin was identified as Artocarpus ovatus Blanco at the Jose Vera Santos Herbarium, Institute of Biology, University of the Philippines, Diliman, Quezon City.

180 www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com General Isolation Procedure A glass column 18 inches in height and beta-Friedelinol, 0 inche internal diameter was packed with silica gel.

The crude extract from the leaves were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in dichloromethane (10% increment) as eluents.

Fifty milliliter fractions were collected.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

A glass column 12 inches in height and 0 chlorophyll a, inch internal diameter was used for the rechromatography.

Two milliliter fractions were collected.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns.

One milliliter fractions were collected.

Isolation The air-dried leaves of Artocarpus ovatus (336.9 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for Polyprenols, days and then filtered.

The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (7 Chlorophyll a, g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment.

The 10% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed Polyprenols, ) in 1% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford Squalene, (25 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 20% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed chlorophyll a, ) in 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford Polyprenols, (8 mg) and Triacylglycerols, chlorophyll a, mg).

The 30% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed Polyprenols, ) in 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether to yield beta-Friedelinol, Chlorophyll a, mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 40% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed Triacylglycerols, ) in 20% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford chlorophyll a, (12 mg) after washing with petroleum ether, followed by Et2O.

Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the air-dried leaves of Artocarpus ovatus led to the isolation of 3beta-friedelinol [8, 9], squalene [10, 11], polyprenol [11, 12], triglycerides , and chlorophyll a [7, 11]. The structures of beta-Friedelinol, Squalene, Polyprenols, Triacylglycerols, were identified by comparison of their 1H and/or 13C NMR data with literature data [8-12]. Although bioassays were not conducted on the isolated compounds, there were previous studies that reported on their biological activities. beta-Friedelinol showed only antibacterial activity (MIC = 12.5-100 mg/ml) and no antifungal activity.

Squalene was reported to significantly suppress colonic ACF formation and crypt multiplicity which strengthened the hypothesis that it possesses chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis.

Squalene showed cardioprotective effect which is related to inhibition of lipid accumulation by its hypolipidemic properties and/or its antioxidant properties.

A recent study reported that tocotrienols, carotenoids, squalene and coenzyme Q10 have anti-proliferative effects on breast cancer cells.

The preventive and therapeutic potential of squalene containing compounds on tumor promotion and regression have been reported.

A recent review on the bioactivities of squalene has been provided.

Polyprenols act as co-enzymes of membrane active transport systems for polysaccharides, peptidoglycans and carbohydrate containing biopolymers.

Polyprenol from Ginkgo biloba L exhibited hepatoprotective effects against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.

Polyprenols from Ginkgo biloba L. exhibited antitumor activity.

The antidyslipidemic activity of polyprenol from Coccinia grandis in high-fat diet-fed hamster model was also reported.

Triacylglycerols exhibited antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, C. albicans, and T. mentagrophytes.

Another study reported that triglycerides showed a direct relationship between toxicity and increasing unsaturation, which in turn correlated with increasing susceptibility to oxidation.

Chlorophyll a and its various derivatives are used in traditional medicine and for therapeutic purposes.

Natural chlorophyll ad its derivatives have been studied for wound healing , anti-inflammatory properties , control of calcium oxalate crystals , utilization as effective agents in photodynamic cancer therapy [29-31], and chemopreventive effects in humans [32-33]. A review on digestion, absorption and cancer preventive activity of dietary chlorophyll has been provided .
