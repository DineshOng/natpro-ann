Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extracts of Cycas edentata led to the isolation of 9alphaH-isopimara-7,15-diene , betasitosteryl fatty acid ester , and a mixture of beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol from the bark; and betasitosteryl fatty acid ester, and a mixture of beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol, from the sclerotesta.

The structure of alphaH-Isopimara-7,15-diene, was elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, while those of 2-3b were identified by comparison of their NMR data with those reported in the literature.

Keywords: Cycas edentata, Cycadaceae, 9alphaH-isopimara-7,15-diene, beta-sitosteryl fatty acid ester, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol.

ycas edentata of the Cycadaceae family is classified as near threatened by the IUCN.

This species which occurs along shorelines is declining due to loss of coastal habitat.

Cycas edentata is native to Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

There are no reported chemical and biological activity studies on Cycas edentata.

This study was conducted as part of our research on the chemical constituents of Cycas species that are endemic and native to the Philippines.

We recently reported the isolation of squalene, betasitosterol, stigmasterol, and triglycerides from the sarcotesta; beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, triglycerides and phytyl fatty acid esters from the endotesta; beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, triglycerides, and beta-sitosteryl fatty acid esters from the sclerotesta; and beta-sitosteryl fatty acid esters from the bark of Cycas sancti-lasallei.

Another Cycas species, Cycas lacrimans yielded isopimaran-ol from the megasporophyll lamina; 9alphaH-isopimara,15-diene and triacylglycerols from the bark; triacylglycerols, oleic acid, and 1,2-dioleylglycerol from the leaflets; triacylglycerols, beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol from the petiole and rachis; beta-sitosterol from the roots; and triacylglycerols and beta-sitosterol from the endotesta and sclerotesta.

We report herein the isolation of 9alphaH-isopimara-7,15diene , beta-sitosteryl fatty acid ester , and a mixture of beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol in about 3.5:1 ratio from the bark; and betasitosteryl fatty acid ester, and a mixture of beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol, in about 3.5:1 ratio from the sclerotesta of Cycas edentata.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the isolation of 1-3b from the plant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedure NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Plant Material Cycas edenta bark and sclerotesta were collected in November 2014 and authenticated by one of the authors (EMGA).

Voucher specimens were deposited in the De La Salle University-Manila Herbarium (DLSUH 3114).

General Isolation Procedure A glass column 18 inches in height and alphaH-Isopimara-7,15-diene, 0 inch internal diameter was used for the chromatography of the crude extracts.

Twenty milliliter fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the rechromatography of smaller fractions from the first column.

Five milliliter fractions were collected.

One milliliter fractions were collected.

Isolation of the Chemical Constituents of the Bark The air-dried bark of Cycas edentata (144 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then filtered.

The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (0.7 g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment.

The CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (3 ) using petroleum ether to afford alphaH-Isopimara-7,15-diene, (3 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 10% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed betasitosteryl fatty acid ester, ) in 5% EtOAc in petroleum ether to yield betasitosteryl fatty acid ester, betasitosteryl fatty acid ester, mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 30% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (4 ) in CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (0.5:0.5:9 by volume) to yield a mixture of beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol, (4 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

Isolation of the Chemical Constituents of the Sclerotesta The air-dried sclerotesta of Cycas edentata (48 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then filtered.
